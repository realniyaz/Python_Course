# Variables 
Variable is like a container that holds data. Creating a variable means to create a location in memory and assigning it some value. 
In Python:
`Syantx : var_name = object_name`

### Examples of Variables

```
name = "Niyaz" #string
age = 21 #numeric 
b = True #boolean
nul = None #Null
```

# Datatypes
Data type specifies the type of value a variable holds. This is required in programming to identify which type of data is being used in a program for efficient work and causing no error.

```
print(type(name)) : str
print(type(age)) : int
```

Here, we used `type(var_name)` which will return the type of the data.

## Types of Datatypes

#### 1. Numeric 
It consists of 3 more types:

`int` : 3, 6 , 10, 77970

`float` : 7.73730, 9.2739

`complex` : 5 + 4j

##### 2. String
`str` : "Hello, World!"

##### 3. Boolean
`True` : when the value is True

`False` : When the value is false

#### 4. Sequence 
`list` : [2,4,"apple"]

`tuple` : (2, 4,5,6)

`dict` : {"name" : "Niyaz","Age" : 21}
